\section{Concluding Remarks}

This thesis starts with a general introduction to differential geometry,
tensor calculus and general relativity. Next, a more specialised introduction to the
3+1 spacetime decomposition, numerical relativity and compact objects, with focus
on boson stars, was given. After this the details of
numerical methods for PDE's and {\sc GRChombo}, the main numerical code used throughout
the thesis, were covered. Along with this, the creation of boson star initial data,
including boosts and the naive superposition of solutions, is given in
detail along with simple examples of their collisions in three spatial dimensions.
The head-on collision result in the prompt collapse to a black hole and the grazing
collision (a collision with small impact parameter) results in the formation of
a black hole with a quasi-long lived scalar field \enquote{wig}. This dynamical 
formation of a hairy black hole from physical collision initial data certainly 
warrants further study.



Super-imposing solutions in general relativity generally does not constitute a new
solution of Einstein's equation; the superposed solution will violate the Hamiltonian
and momentum constraints in Eqs(\ref{nr:eq:ham}) and (\ref{nr:eq:mom}). While
constraint satisfying initial data for black-hole binaries is well known at this point,
the same cannot be said about boson star binaries. When super-imposing
compact objects in general relativity the overall constraint violation reduces with
increasing separation and so it is common in the literature to produce
boson star binary initial data with plain superposition making the object separation
large where possible. The caveat of this approach is that the superposition error
decays quite slowly with increasing the separation and
a boson-star binary that has an acceptable level of constraint violation would typically require
a separation that is too large to be simulated with numerical relativity.


In chapter \ref{malaise} we have conducted symmetric headon boson
star collisions and compare two superposition schemes. The two superposition schemes
are the regular naive superposition of section \ref{grchombo:sec:superposition}
and the modified superposition scheme of section \ref{mal:sec:improvedsuperposition}.
Our results showed that the modified superposition scheme is a major improvement
over the naive superposition method when measuring the constraint equations. Additionally,
naive superposition was observed to induce spurious unphysical behaviour such as
excited stars and gravitational collapse. However, the modified superposition
scheme is not perfect, there is still some residual constraint violation; on the
other hand this scheme could be a useful first guess in a true constraint solver
when one becomes available. Given the simplicity of implementation and
effectiveness of the modified superposition scheme we recommend its use to the
general numerical relativity community. A future study to considering non-symmetric
binaries is certainly warranted.




Next the QFS system for a generic continuity equation in curved space is derived in
section (\ref{q:qfs_system}) and is explicitly given for spherical coordinate
surfaces. The QFS system is first used to derive expressions for the Noether charge
flux density $\mathcal{F}$ of a complex scalar field and a complex Proca field;
both fields have a global $U(1)$ symmetry which gives rise to the conserved Noether charge.
Additionally, the QFS system is used to re-derive the well known Noether charge density
$\mathcal{Q}$.
Next, expressions for $\mathcal{Q}$, $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ are derived for
energy momentum-currents (of matter) where $\mathcal{S}$ represents the creation/destruction of
charge; $\mathcal{S}$ is called the source term. These expressions are then given for use
with angular momentum explicity; expressions for the energy density are also given
in agreement with the literature \cite{Clough_2021}. The three variables give an intuitive understanding
of the behaviour of angular momentum (or any charge) where $\mathcal{Q}$ is the amount of
angular momentum in the matter field, $\mathcal{F}$ is the flux leaving an arbitrary
surface and $\mathcal{S}$ is the destruction or creation of angular momentum; the
destruction/creation of angular momentum of the matter field can be understood as
the transfer of angular momentum between matter and curvature.

In addition to the intuitive understanding of local angular momentum (and charges with
continuity equations in general) bought by the QFS system it
also has numerical uses. One use is that combining the the $\mathcal{Q}$ and 
$\mathcal{S}$ variables (as outlined in section \ref{q:sect:conv}) is less prone to oscillations 
caused by the transfer of energy-momentum between curvature and matter fields. The
reduction of oscillation in these variables can assist in obtaining a clean convergence test.
Additionally, the QFS equation can be used as an extra check on the resolution of
a numerical relativity evolution. In the continuum limit, the QFS equation~\ref{q:qfs_system}
should be obeyed exactly and the error measures defined in section \ref{q:sect:conv} should vanish.
In the case that Einstein's equation is not assumed to hold in the underlying continuity 
equation of the QFS system, 
this error measure will not depend on constaint violation; for example the 
continuity of energy-momentum currents only assumes that $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$.


After the derivation and technical background of the QFS system had been derived, it
was applied to an example spacetime. This example consists of the numerical simulation
of a boson star collision using the {\sc GRchombo} code, described in section \ref{grchombo:sec:grchombo},
ending in the formation of a quasi-stable object. Before the collision of the stars, 
the angular momentum measure agrees well with the Newtonian limit which is a good
check on the normalisation of the QFS system's angular momentum variable. The relative error 
(defined in section \ref{q:sect:conv}) of the QFS system is then 
subjected to a numerical convergence test which shows approximate third order convergence.
After $8000$ time units the highest resolution simulation shows an approximate error measure
of $3\%$.


Given the ability to measure the flux through an arbitrary surface, the QFS system is
well suited to cutting out unwanted volumes or including only desired ones. Including
only a given volume is useful if we want to check the resolution (or make more
accurate measures) over a finite region of spacetime.
An example where we might want a moving volume is to track the flux of a quantity
falling into a moving black hole.
Cutting out pre-specified volumes could be useful in black-hole spacetimes where we
don't want to perform a measure within a certain radius of the singularity. One caveat of
this approach is that the effect of a moving volume (with respect to the coordinates)
has not been computed here and would need to be taken into account if it is to be used.



The QFS system is easily included into a numerical code and will 
hopefully prove useful to the Numerical Relativity community
for the better measurement of local energy-momentum of matter and Noether charge aswell
as provide a powerful check on simulation resolution.



Combining the aforementioned superposition improvement scheme with the 
diagnostic power of the QFS system, a boson-star collision with a long-lived 
remnant was then studied. The boson-star binary perfomed a grazing collision that 
promptly collided to form a highly purturbed remnant. This remnant 
produces a long-lasting gravitational wave (GW) {\it afterglow} which differs greatly from more
traditional GW sources. This gravitational afterglow provides a distinct channel for 
detection, given its long timescale, and if these kinds of collisions occur in nature
with sufficient population their radiation could theoretically result in a stochastic GW background. 
The reader is reminded that the physical situation has not been
fine tuned in any way and is expected to be generic
for a finite region of parameter space. Infact, similar behaviour was seen in
preliminary testing when varying the impact parameter by an order of magnitude.
This simulation highlights the fact that there is more to boson-star collision
phenomenology than merger waveforms analogous to black-hole collision waveforms.
Further exploration of the parameter space and the resulting afterglow (and 
different boson star theories) is required to relate theoretical stochastic 
GW backgrounds to boson star populations. 

Our results furthermore demonstrate that boson-star mergers efficiently radiate angular momentum
consistent with previous studies. In this collision the angular momentum of the remnant 
decays with a half-life of $t_{1/2}= 4\times 10^3~m^{-1}$. Interestingly we also note that
the minima and maxima of the $(2,2)$ and $(2,0)$ modes of the GW signal are initially 
anti-aligned but drift to alignment over time (Fig.~\ref{ag:fig:AngMom}). 
This gradual shift of the 
GW mode alignment approximately coincides with shedding of angular momentum from the
remnant. Therefore we tentatively suggest that the alignment of the GW modes could
carry information regarding the angular momentum of the remnant.



Finally, the consequences of non-zero eccentricity on the gravitational wave signal
and the kick magnitude and direction
of un-equal mass Schwarzschild black-hole binaries has been studied. A kick is a
gravitational phenomenon in which a system radiates linear momentum (in gravitational waves)
resulting in the centre of mass being \enquote{kicked} in the opposite direction. A series of
binaries with mass ratios $q=2/3,$ $1/2,$ and $1/3$ are simulated; these binaries perform about 3 orbits
in the quasicircular limit. We also examine a comparison set of
simulations with $q=1/2$, and a greater initial
separation, which completes approximately six orbits in the quasicircular limit.
In all cases the black holes were initially placed on the x-axis with boosts of
equal and opposite momentum perpendicular to the x-axis; therefore the x-axis is
initially the periapsis.

In the black-hole binaries simulted, a maximum in the kick magnitude is seen for an eccentricity
of $e\sim 0.5$ and is approximately $25\%$ larger than the quasi circular case. In addition
to this, the kick magnitude is seen to oscillate, with respect to eccentricity, by
$\sim 10\%$ of the quasicircular limit. As the eccenticity tends to unity,
in the case of a headon collision, the kick magnitude becomes small. These simulations
are simulated with two codes, {\sc GRChombo} and {\sc Lean}; both codes show an error
budget of $3$-$4\,\%$.

The oscillatory behaviour of the kick magnitude is attributed to the final infall
angle (or direction) with respect to the periapsis of the black holes in merger.
The notion of an infall angle in
general relativity is not well defined and it is approximated here by considering the
angle made by the final kick to the x-axis. When the kick magnitude is plotted as a
function of infall angle (in Figure~\ref{bhkick:fig:theta-plots}) it displays the
hypothesized oscillatory behaviour with an period close to $2\pi$; any deviation
here is attributed to periapsis precession.

The dependance of the oscillatory behaviour of the kick with respect to the initial
eccenticity is explored in the second set of simulations with
$q=1/2$ and a larger initial separation (or a less negative binding energy). The
oscillations are more pronounced in this situation which is attributed to the longer
infall time which gives more time for phase differences between similar binaries to
build up.

While the findings of these black-hole kick simulations answer many questions, they
also ask more. From a study of two sets of simulations with different
initial separations we are led to believe
that the oscillatory dependance of the kick on the initial 
separation is sensitive; to what extent this is hidden by
gravitational circularisation
\footnote{Gravitational circularisation refers to the natural phenomenon in general
relativity where eccentricity is damped over time eventually turning an eccentric
binary into a quasi-circular one.}
over longer inspirals is unknown. A study of long eccentic inspirals would likely require post newtonian
methods. Other interesting studies could include tracking the precession of
the periapsis in this strong gravity regime, kicks in
high boost grazing collisions or even the possibility of kicks in compact-object
binaries such as boson stars.
